You are given a dataset of exam scores for a class of students across 3 subjects (Math, Physics, Chemistry). Your task is to use NumPy arrays to analyze the data.

| Student # | Math | Physics | Chemistry |
|-----------+------+---------+-----------|
|         1 |   85 |      90 |        78 |
|         2 |   72 |      88 |        91 |
|         3 |   93 |      87 |        80 |
|         4 |   65 |      70 |        75 |
|         5 |   78 |      82 |        84 |

* Array Generation
Use ~np.array()~ to represent the grade table as a 2D array.
* Array Inspection & Basic Stats
- Print the dimension of the array.
- Print the shape of the array.
- Compute the average score for each subject.
- Find the highest and lowest score across all exams.

* Indexing & Slicing
- Extract the scores of the 3rd student.
- Get the Physics scores of all students.
- Select the scores of students who scored above 80 in Math.

* Array Manipulation
- Add 5 bonus points to all Chemistry scores.
- Create a new column representing the total score for each student.
- Normalize all scores (divide by the max possible score, 100).

* Boolean Masking & Filtering
- Find all students who scored above 85 in any subject.
- Count how many students failed (score < 70) in at least one subject.

* Broadcasting & Advanced Operations
- Compute the percentage for each student (assuming max score per subject is 100).
